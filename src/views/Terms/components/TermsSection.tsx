        <p>
          5.1 The Platform is a sports fan loyalty platform, built on blockchain technology. It uses tokens which act as
          a form of currency which the Team and Sponsors can sell to Fans, and Fans can sell to other Fans (Tokens).
          Tokens can be purchased using Australian dollars (via a credit card or debit card), cryptocurrency (via a
          cryptocurrency wallet accepted by us) or non-fungible token (NFT) (via a cryptocurrency wallet accepted by
          us).
        </p>
        <p>
          5.2 Teams and Sponsors can sell the Tokens to Fans and Fans can also earn Tokens for performing certain tasks
          and behaviours on the Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.3 The Platform also aims to connect Sponsors of Teams closer to Fans by allowing them to reward Fans for
          interacting with Sponsor content on the Platform.

          any agreement entered into between a Fan, Sponsor and/or a Team and we have no control over the conduct of

        </p>
        <p>
          5.5 A Team wanting to offer Tokens to Fans creates an Account on the Platform and posts an accurate and
          complete description of their sporting team and the offers they can provide to Fans, from time to time,
          including the price payable for Tokens (Team Token Fees) and the details of particular offers (for example,
          Team membership offers, discounted tickets to matches) (Team Offers).
        </p>
        <p>
          5.6 A Sponsor wanting to offer Tokens to Fans creates an Account on the Platform and posts an accurate and

          9.1 Any Membership will only commence once the Platform is live and ready to use, notwithstanding that you may
          have accepted these Terms before this occurs.
        </p>

        <p>
          9.3 If you are a Team, your Membership may begin with a free trial. The free trial period of your Membership
          will last for the period specified on the Platform or in your Account. We determine free trial eligibility in
          our sole discretion and we may limit eligibility to prevent free trial abuse. We reserve the right to revoke
          the free trial and suspend your Account at any time in the event that we determine that you are not eligible.
          If you do not cancel during the free trial period, we will charge your chosen payment method for the
          Membership you have chosen and its corresponding membership fee (Membership Fee) on the day your free trial
          ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.4 If you are a Team, your Membership is subject to a minimum term, as set out in your Account. Without

        </p>
        <p>
          9.5 If you are a Team, unless your Membership is suspended or terminated in accordance with these Terms, your

          email that you wish to cancel, suspend or vary your Membership at least 24 hours before the next Payment Date.
          If you vary your membership and the Membership Fee also varies, you will be charged the new Membership Fee on
          the next Payment Date. If you are a Fan or a Sponsor, you may cancel or suspend your Account at any time
          through your Account or via email.
        </p>
        <p>9.7 To the extent permitted by law, the Membership Fee is non-refundable and non-cancellable once paid.</p>
        <p>
          9.8 We may need to change the Membership (for example, the inclusions and exclusions) and Membership Fee from
          time to time. If you are a Team and we change your Membership or Membership Fee, we will provide you with 30
          days’ notice of the change. After 30 days, we will apply the new Membership Fee to your existing payment
          details for all future Payment Dates, and your Membership changes will take effect on the same date. If you do
          not agree with the new Membership or Membership Fee, you may cancel your Membership in accordance with these
          terms.

          strictly a matter between the relevant Fan and Team or Sponsor. The terms and conditions agreed to between the

          (including claims for returns or refunds) with the other Party directly and in good faith, either on the
          Platform or through external communication methods. In the event that a dispute cannot be resolved through

          13.1 If we choose to conduct identity verification or background checks on any Team or Sponsor, to the extent
          permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties of any kind, either express or implied, that such checks will
          identify prior misconduct by a Team or Sponsor or guarantee that a Team or Sponsor will not engage in
          misconduct in the future. Any verification of Teams on the Platform is not an endorsement or recommendation
          that the Team is trustworthy or suitable. You should do your own due diligence before transacting with another
          user of the Platform.

        <p>
          13.2 As a Team or Sponsor, we may offer you the option of verifying your identity and/or validating your

          information (Identity Check); and (2) Third Party ID Services may provide us with your personal information or
          sensitive information, and you consent to us receiving and using this information to enable us to perform an

          13.4 Following a successful Identity Check, you acknowledge and agree that (1) we may permit you to use
          verification signs, icons or badges in connection with your Account to indicate that a successful Identity
          Check has been performed (Verification Icon); and (2) a Verification Icon may only be used by the individual
          or business for whom the relevant Identity Check has been successfully performed and the relevant Verification
          Icon has been issued, and then, only where that individual is directly providing the relevant goods and
          services .
        </p>
        <p>
          13.5 You acknowledge and agree that (1) the Identity Check and any issuance of a Verification Icon may not be
          fully accurate, as they are dependent on the information provided by the relevant individual or business
          and/or information or checks performed by third parties; and (2) you should not rely on the Identity Checks or
          the Verification Icons, and you should make your own inquiries as to the accuracy, legitimacy, validity,

        <p>21.1 Despite our best efforts, there are risks associated with our offering, which include:</p>
        <p>
          (a) Software risk – While we will use our best efforts and develop our software with high security standards,
          we do not warrant or represent that the Tokens, the Platform or any related software are secure or safe, or
          protected from fishing, malware or other malicious attacks. Further, the Tokens, the Platform and related
          software may contain weaknesses, bugs, vulnerabilities, viruses or other defects which may have a material
          adverse effect on the operation of the Tokens, the Platform or any such related software or may lead to losses
          and damages for you;
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Blockchain risk – The Tokens will be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain main network, and may also be
          deployed on other blockchains in the future. Accordingly, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of such
          blockchain(s) may have a material adverse effect on the Tokens.

        <p>
          (c) Legal uncertainty - Our intended activities, as set out in these Terms, are subject to Australian laws and
          regulations. We might be obliged to obtain different licenses or other permissive documents in Australia and,
          accordingly, our business in Australia shall always be subject to obtaining licenses or permissive documents,
          if so directed by applicable laws or government agencies. Despite our best efforts and seeking legal advice,
          there is a risk that certain activities may be deemed in violation of any existing or new laws or regulations.
          Penalties for any such potential violation would be unknown. Additionally, changes in applicable laws or
          regulations or evolving interpretations of existing law may result in increased compliance costs which may
          affect our ability to perform our business operations.
